	<p>
		At DUAHTOR, your privacy matters to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you visit our pre-launch website or join our early access waitlist.
	</p>

	<h2>What We Collect</h2>
	<p>When you sign up for our waitlist or fill out a form, we may collect:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Your name</li>
		<li>Email address or WhatsApp number</li>
		<li>Your role (e.g., student, parent, educator)</li>
		<li>Location details (such as county or country)</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
	<p>We use your information to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Keep you updated on our app launch and developments</li>
		<li>Send you sneak peeks, demo invites, and early access opportunities</li>
		<li>Understand our future users better so we can build a product that fits your needs</li>
		<li>Contact you about exclusive pre-launch offers and community updates</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		We will not sell or share your data with third parties for marketing purposes. Your information stays between you and DUAHTOR.
	</p>

	<h2>Your Rights</h2>
	<p>You can request to update or delete your information at any time by contacting us at:</p>
	<p>ðŸ“© info@myduahtor.com</p>

	<h2>Data Security</h2>
	<p>
		We take appropriate steps to keep your information secure. However, since no system is 100% foolproof, we cannot guarantee absolute security â€” especially before our full app launch.
	</p>

		We may update this privacy policy as our app and platform evolve. Any changes will be posted here.
