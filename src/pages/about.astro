	<h2>Revolutionizing Education in Liberia</h2>
	<p>
		DUAHTOR is Liberia's first AI-powered learning companion, designed specifically to address the unique educational challenges faced by Liberian students. We believe that every student deserves access to quality education, regardless of their location, economic background, or the availability of traditional educational resources.
	</p>

	<h2>Our Mission</h2>
	<p>
		To democratize quality education across Liberia by providing AI-powered, personalized learning experiences that adapt to each student's unique needs, learning pace, and local context. We're committed to bridging the educational gap and empowering the next generation of Liberian leaders, innovators, and thinkers.
	</p>

	<h2>The Challenge We're Solving</h2>
	<p>
		Liberia's education system faces significant challenges: overcrowded classrooms with teacher-to-student ratios often exceeding 1:50, limited access to quality tutoring services, unreliable internet connectivity in rural areas, and a shortage of educational resources tailored to the local curriculum and context.
	</p>

	<p>
		Many students struggle with homework without adequate support, while parents may lack the resources or knowledge to provide academic assistance. Traditional tutoring is often unaffordable or unavailable, leaving students to navigate their educational journey with limited guidance.
	</p>
