	<h2>Education in Liberia Isn't Broken, It's Been Left Behind.</h2>
	<p>
		Across Liberia, students still sit on bare floors in overcrowded classrooms. Teachers, though dedicated, are often forced to teach with outdated textbooks, limited training, and no real support. Parents, who sacrifice greatly to send their children to school, quietly hope that effort alone will be enough. But too often, it's not.
	</p>
	<p>
		Even the most determined learners fall through the cracks, not for lack of intelligence, but for lack of access.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>We've lived this reality. And we've had enough.</strong>
	</p>

	<h2>The Turning Point</h2>
	<p>
		In November 2023, three of us, <strong>Massalan</strong>, a high school student who saw firsthand how the system fails learners like her; <strong>Faith</strong>, a peer equally driven to change things; and <strong>Boniface</strong>, a mentor who spent years guiding youth and watching their potential go untapped, met through the Liberia Diamond Challenge, a national innovation program backed by YONER Liberia and the University of Delaware.
	</p>
	<p>
		What brought us together wasn't just a competition, it was a shared frustration. A shared question:
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>What if we could build what we never had?</strong>
	</p>

	<h2>We Started Listening</h2>
	<p>
		We didn't begin by building tech.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>We began by listening.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		We spoke to students, teachers, parents, and working adults across the country. What we uncovered was both urgent and undeniable:
	</p>
	<h3>1. Too many students. Too few teachers.</h3>
	<p>One teacher to 60+ students makes personal learning impossible.</p>
	
	<h3>2. Textbooks from decades ago.</h3>
	<p>No access to modern tools, videos, or personalized help.</p>
	
	<h3>3. Tutoring is a luxury.</h3>
	<p>Only wealthier families can afford extra learning support.</p>
	
	<h3>4. Working adults are left out.</h3>
	<p>They want to learn, but flexible, affordable options are rare.</p>

	<h2>So We Built DUAHTOR</h2>
	<p>
		DUAHTOR is an app and a Liberian-built learning companion for students, educators, parents, and professionals.
	</p>
	<p>It offers:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>AI-powered tutoring</strong> that adapts to each learner's pace.</li>
		<li><strong>Assignment support</strong> that explains, not just solves.</li>
		<li><strong>A Super Reading Coach</strong> for literacy and fluency.</li>
		<li><strong>Offline access</strong> for areas with poor internet.</li>
		<li><strong>Professional courses</strong> to upskill working learners.</li>
		<li><strong>A resource vault</strong> for teachers, and</li>
		<li><strong>A dashboard</strong> for parents to stay involved.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		We didn't build DUAHTOR in a boardroom, we built it in classrooms, homes, and conversations. It's rooted in reality, tested by real people, and guided by a mission we live daily.
	</p>

	<h2>The Road Hasn't Been Easy</h2>
	<p>
		Our journey hasn't been without setbacks.
	</p>
	<p>
		When we were invited to pitch DUAHTOR at the global finals in the U.S., a visa denial stopped us cold.
	</p>
	<p>
		When we tried to raise funds, doors closed, again and again.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>But we never stopped.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Every "no" only confirmed why we're doing this. Because the need doesn't wait.
	</p>

	<h2>What Drives Us Now</h2>
	<p>
		We're not trying to build the next trendy app.
	</p>
	<p>
		We're trying to make sure that the next Massalan doesn't give up.
	</p>
	<p>
		That Faith's little sister doesn't fall behind just because she lives in a rural town.
	</p>
	<p>
		That a parent like Boniface can finally see real progress, not just school fees.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>This is personal.</strong><br>
		<strong>This is national.</strong><br>
		<strong>This is possible.</strong>
	</p>

	<h2>Can Our Shared Vision Earn Your Support?</h2>
	<p>
		We believe education in Liberia can be better. Smarter. More personal.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>But we can't do it alone.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you're an investor, partner, parent, educator, or change-maker who believes every Liberian learner deserves a fair shot, we welcome your support to rebuild learning from the ground up.
